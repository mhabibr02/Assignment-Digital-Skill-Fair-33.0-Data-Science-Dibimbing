Description

### Objective
The purpose of this project is to classify wine types using the Wine dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about different wine samples, categorized into three classes, based on their chemical attributes. The Decision Tree Classifier algorithm is employed to build a predictive model, with the goal of accurately determining the wine class based on these features.

### Goals
1. Accurately classify wine samples into one of three wine categories.
2. Provide interpretable insights into the most significant chemical attributes influencing the classification.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and determine its effectiveness in real-world applications involving similar datasets.

### Results
1. The accuracy of the model on the test data, indicating its performance in predicting unseen samples.
2. A visualization of the decision tree structure, providing insights into the key features used for classification.
3. Identification of the most important features contributing to the decision-making process, such as alcohol content, flavonoids, and proanthocyanins.
   
### Conclusion
The Decision Tree Classifier demonstrated effective performance on the Wine dataset, achieving a high accuracy in classifying wine samples. The model provided interpretable results, highlighting the chemical properties critical to wine classification. This study reaffirms the applicability of decision trees in solving classification problems, particularly when feature importance and model explainability are crucial.
